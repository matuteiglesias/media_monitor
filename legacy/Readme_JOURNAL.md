Let’s map what you *actually* have to the target we discussed, then I’ll point out the sharp edges and propose the minimal refactor.

# What you have now (by stage)

1. **Daemon & staging orchestration**
   `00_daemon.py` runs an hourly pipeline with per-stage skip logic, backfill, and param passing. It builds commands like `01_digests --trigger-time <iso>`, `03_headlines_digests --digest-id <YYYYMMDDTHH>`, `04_promptflow_run --digest-id …`, etc, and persists per-hour status so completed stages are skipped. Backfill is supported via `find_missing_backfill_targets`. This is a solid skeleton.&#x20;

2. **Feed intake + slicing**
   `01_digests.py` hits \~7 Google News RSS queries, normalizes entries, assigns a short `uid`, sorts by `Published`, writes an hourly CSV, and then emits “time window” slices (4h, 8h, 2day, 3day, weekly, fortnight) keyed by the trigger time logic. Good: you already normalize titles and dedupe per run.&#x20;

3. **Master index**
   `02_master_index_update.py` walks `data/rss_slices/**.csv`, appends new ones to a master table, dedupes on `index_id` (preferring the *uid* when present), sorts by `Published`, and tracks processed files. This becomes the canonical `master_index.csv`.&#x20;

4. **Digest grouping and JSONL**
   `03_headlines_digests.py` splits each CSV into topic groups of bounded size, saves Markdown headline lists, then aggregates those `.md` files into a `digest_jsonls/<YYYYMMDDTHH>.jsonl` with a `digest_group_id` like `YYYYMMDDTHH::window::topic::NN`. This is your prompt input.&#x20;

5. **PromptFlow run wrapper**
   `04_promptflow_run.py` calls `pf run create …`, then scrapes the latest `~/.promptflow/.runs/**/output.jsonl`, and stores a copy under `data/pf_out/pfout_<digest_id>_<timestamp>.jsonl`. Works, but “latest run” is brittle under concurrency.&#x20;

6. **PF output exploder & joins**
   `05_explode_pf_outputs.py` parses PF outputs to two streams:

* **articles** (cluster rows → `article_id`, `title`, topic, etc), and
* **seed ideas**.
  It then enriches articles by joining `master_ref.csv` to recover `index_id` and optionally merges `scraped_links.jsonl` content, yielding `articles_exploded.jsonl`, `seed_ideas_exploded.jsonl`, and `articles_to_scrape.jsonl`.&#x20;

7. **Scraping**
   `06_scrape_contents.py` opens each URL with Selenium/Chrome, copies page HTML via clipboard, and logs JSON lines to `scraped_links.jsonl` keyed by `index_id`. It skips ones already scraped. This is operational, but fragile.&#x20;

8. **Idea enrichment**
   `07_idea_seed_compiler.py` explodes ideas by `source_ids`, reconstructs keys (`digest_file::article_id`), and joins articles and scraped content.&#x20;

---

# Where this aligns with the proposed design

* **Stages are decoupled** with artifacts between them (CSV, JSONL) — good for idempotency and testing. This mirrors the “strict data contracts” idea.&#x20;
* **Digest → PF → explode** is already a clean “synthesis path”; a thin Publisher stage is all that’s missing.
* **Backfill** and **skip** behavior in the daemon is the right ops posture (hands-free with recovery).&#x20;

---

# The sharp edges (these will bite later)

1. **Identifier drift (hour vs minute; uid length)**

* `01_digests` uses `digest_id = %Y%m%dT%H%M` (with minutes). `03_headlines_digests` expects filenames and `digest_id` with **hour only** (`\d{8}T\d{2}`), and the code that once appended “00” seconds is commented. This can silently drop files when aggregating. Fix the contract to a single canonical `digest_id_hour` *everywhere*.
* `02_master_index_update` falls back to an **8-char** `index_id` if `uid` is missing, but later `05_explode_pf_outputs` filters `master_ref` to **10-char** `index_id` values. Those rows will never enrich — a correctness hole. Unify to a single 10-char scheme (or 12+) and retro-migrate.

2. **Brittle PromptFlow run capture**
   You pick “the latest” `.runs/.../output.jsonl`, which is race-prone. You should read the **specific run id** returned by `pf run create` and fetch that run’s output, then name your output `pfout_<digest_id>_<run_id>.jsonl`.&#x20;

3. **Scraper fragility and focus-stealing**
   Selenium + clipboard copy is flaky, slow, and will fight your desktop focus. It also masks rendering errors as empty strings. Use headless Playwright with `page.content()` and a Readability/Boilerpipe step to store both *raw\_html* and *article\_html/text*. Maintain a per-domain backoff.&#x20;

4. **Filename parsing is strict**
   `robust_parse_filename` enforces `headlines_<window>_<YYYYMMDDTHH>_<topic>_<NN>.md`. Any drift breaks aggregation. Either emit these names *from the code that writes them* (you do) and add a preflight that warns when **zero matches** after a `--digest-id`. Also consider serializing the same metadata in a sidecar JSON to avoid regex dependence.&#x20;

5. **No formal schemas / validators**
   You’re hand-assembling dicts/frames across boundaries. A small `pydantic` model per artifact (RawFeedRow, DigestGroup, PFOutClusterRow, ArticleRef) would catch 80 percent of issues early and make tests trivial. The flow already benefits from typed expectations (e.g., `Published` utc, `index_id` str len N).&#x20;

6. **Join keys are reconstructed multiple ways**
   You construct `key = digest_file::article_id` in different places (some drop seconds, some pad with zeros). That increases “off-by-format” bugs. Centralize a helper that *always* returns the canonical key from inputs.

# Minimal refactor to “hands-free” and robust (keep your structure)

**Contract cleanup (do this first):**

* Standardize IDs:

  * `digest_id_hour = YYYYMMDDTHH` is the *only* routing id.
  * `digest_id_min = YYYYMMDDTHHMM` is allowed only inside `01_digests` for filenames but *also* emit `digest_id_hour` alongside it.
  * `index_id` = **10-char** sha1 of `Title + Source` everywhere (recompute where missing).
    Patch points: `01_digests` (emit both hours/minutes), `02_master_index_update` (remove 8-char fallback), `03_headlines_digests` (accept `digest_id_hour` only), `05_explode_pf_outputs` (stop length filtering).

**PromptFlow determinism:**

* Capture the run id from `pf run create`’s stdout or use `--name` to set it deterministically (`run_<digest_id_hour>`). Read exactly that run’s output, and name the artifact `pfout_<digest_id_hour>_<runid>.jsonl`.&#x20;

**Scraper swap:**

* Replace clipboard scraping with headless extraction:

  * Try `requests` + `readability-lxml` first; fall back to Playwright when `status!=200` or content too short.
  * Persist `{index_id, url, status, raw_html_len, article_text_len, fetched_at}`.
  * Respect `robots.txt`, and add per-domain rate limiting and retries with backoff.&#x20;

**Schema validation:**

* Add `pydantic` models at boundaries:

  * `FeedRow` (Published must be tz-aware UTC),
  * `DigestGroup` (topic, group\_id, uids\[]),
  * `PFClusterRow` (article\_ids\[], dedup titles count must match),
  * `ArticleRef` (has index\_id, link),
  * `ScrapeRecord` (has index\_id, html/text non-empty).
    Reject early and log to `data/status_logs/`.&#x20;

**Single “key” helper:**

* Put in `utils.py`:

  * `digest_key(digest_id_hour: str, article_id: str) -> str`
  * `stable_index_id(title, source) -> str`
    Replace ad-hoc constructions in `05_explode_pf_outputs.py` and `07_idea_seed_compiler.py`.

**Observability:**

* In `00_daemon`, after each stage, write a compact JSON status with counts (files matched, digests created, pf rows parsed, articles to scrape, scraped OK). You already log per stage; add a small “metrics” block per hour for dashboards.&#x20;

---

# Concrete patches (surgical)

* **Unify `digest_id`**
  In `03_headlines_digests.main`: set `digest_id = args.digest_id or ts['digest_id_h']` and *do not* compare against minute-precision names. Keep the `filename_prefix = f"{window_type}_{digest_id}"` and ensure `01_digests` writes slices that include the **hour** in their filenames. Today you match `r"^([a-zA-Z0-9]+_window)_\d{8}T\d{4}$"` already — lean into that.&#x20;

* **Drop the 10-char filter**
  In `05_explode_pf_outputs.py`, remove the line `master_ref = master_ref.loc[master_ref.index_id.str.len() == 10]` or replace it with a normalization to your unified length. Otherwise you silently lose rows.&#x20;

* **Normalize `index_id` generation**
  In `02_master_index_update.process_csv_file`, if `uid` missing, compute the **same** 10-char sha1 as `01_digests.compute_uid` (copy the function to `utils` and import it). Don’t introduce an 8-char variant.

* **PromptFlow run selection**
  In `04_promptflow_run.py`, parse the return value or stdout from `pf run create` to obtain the run folder, instead of globbing `flow_variant_0_*`. Save output with both `digest_id` and `run_id`.&#x20;

* **Scraper replacement**
  In `06_scrape_contents.py`, replace the clipboard logic with `page.content()` or a `requests` path; add a guard that drops pages with `<N` characters and retries with a different strategy.&#x20;

---

# What’s still missing to “close the loop”

* **Publisher stage** (tiny): take PF-exploded clusters plus scraped/fulltext and emit an `ArticleDraft` JSON (headline, dek, body\_html, citations) and then a persisted `Article` row (for your site), plus trigger web revalidation. This is a thin script in your style — it sits after `05_explode_pf_outputs.py`.
* **Two quality gates** (lightweight, today):

  * Ensure each draft cites ≥2 distinct sources present in the cluster.
  * Headline/dek length and “no empty paragraph” checks before publish.

These are small, but they convert your current excellent *assembly line* into a complete “hands-free” loop with basic guarantees.

---

# Bottom line

Your layout already matches the staged, contract-driven pipeline we outlined. The largest risks are *identifier drift* (hour vs minute; 8 vs 10 chars) and a brittle PF/scraper integration. Fix those, add a tiny Publisher and two gates, and you’re at a maintainable, automated news machine with the Python backend doing the heavy lifting — and a frontend you can swap in later without touching ingestion.
